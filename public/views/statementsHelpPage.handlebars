  <p>
    Statements are how you make your stance on an issue known.<br>When a member of the population can see that your stances on the issue match theirs they are more likely to vote for you.<br>Your statements can also affect public opinion of the issues.
    <br>Be careful not to change your stance on an issue a lot.<br>The population won't trust what you have to say if you aren't consistent.<br>It will take an hour to make a statement to the public.
