	Polling Results can be viewed in three ways. Pie Graphs, Bar Graphs, and a Table. <br>
	All of these results can be filtered by major, social group, or both. <br>
	When viewing the graphs the data will be seperated by question and you will view the data for all the appluicable responses to the question.<br>
	The table shows you how each student reponded to each question. <br>
