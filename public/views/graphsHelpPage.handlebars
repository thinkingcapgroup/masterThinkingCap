	Polling Results can be viewed in three ways. Pie Graphs, Bar Graphs, and a Table. 
	All of these results can be filtered by major, social group, or both. 
	When viewing the graphs the data will be seperated by question and you will view the data for all the appluicable responses to the question.
	The table shows you how each student reponded to each question.
